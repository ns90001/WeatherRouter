# WeatherRouter

Weather Router is a Java and React web-app built to improve driving safety. We aim to increase driversâ€™ awareness of the weather while on the road and suggest safe driving routes to prevent driving in dangerous conditions. Our app is localized to Rhode Island -- but can be extended to entire US with a larger dataset.

## How to Build and Run

First, ```cd``` into the "frontend" directory of this project. From there the command ```npm start ``` should
launch the front-end. (Note: you may need to run ```npm install``` before this).

After this, you will need to download and move the "maps.sqlite3" file from this link:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/152pf-zIwtlT9aOAR22bECXPvtKSyjIOf?usp=sharing
into the directory data/maps

Next, open another terminal and execute the command ```.\run --gui``` into the main project directory.
After it runs, the program will start up a REPL. Enter ```map data/maps/maps.sqlite3``` and wait for the
REPL to print ```map set to data/maps/maps.sqlite3```.

Now you may interact with the program through the GUI!
